implement get/set size/mode/time with tests

add syntax to extract all:
	handle extract ?destination?

add directory option to list to limit output:
	handle list -directory path

progress callbacks:
	sevenzip open ?-callback script? ...
	handle extract ?-callback script? ...
	sevenzip create ?-callback script? ...
		where callback is `proc cb {op??? item? progress? total?}`

unload 7z library without fatal `rename sevenzip ""`

internals: streams should be owned by callbacks as members?
